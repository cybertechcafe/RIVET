# RIVET: Revit Installation Vigilant Error Terminator


## Intro

The "Revit Installation Vigilant Error Terminator" is a script that auto close the annoying errors that hold up an AutoDesk Building Design Suite Revit 2015 installation


## Reasoning

Anyone who has installed The AutoDesk Building Design Suite as much as we have know that the software installer provided is, well, pure and utter crap. One of the most ANNOYING things that it does is display alerts or errors that AutoDesk support has told us numerous times "Oh that happens every time, don't worry about them, just hit OK to continue". This is frustrating as the installation takes between 2 and 10 hours to install and having to babysit the installer for these meaningless pointless errors (that AutoDesk has seemingly no plan to fix).

## How it works

Thanks to some magically mystical magic stuff (AutoIt mainly) we wrote a script, compiled it into an exe and when run, it sits and waits for a specific string that we have thoroughly vetted to only target the pesky unimportant errors and NOT molest your important informational errors.

## Usage

Download the preocompiled binary, run.
OR
Download the AutoIt script and use AutoIt to compile and run
